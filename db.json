(\"Got that?\")  [Verse 1] Feet don't fail me now Take me to the finish line Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design? I feel so alone on a Friday night Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine? It's like I told you, honey (\"Louder!\")  [Pre-Chorus] Don't make me sad, don't make me cry Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why Keep making me laugh—let's go get high The road is long, we carry on Try to have fun in the meantime  [Chorus] Come and take a walk on the wild side Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain You like your girls insane (\"Louder!\", \"Alright!\") Choose your last words, this is the last time 'Cause you and I—we were born to die  You might also like Peppers Lana Del Rey Fingertips Lana Del Rey Paris, Texas Lana Del Rey",
